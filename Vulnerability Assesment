--- Vulnerability Assesment ---



Vulnerability Assessment - Utilising vulnerability scanners all discovered hosts can then be tested for vulnerabilities. The result would then be analysed to determine if there any vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain access to a target host on a network. A number of tests carried out by these scanners are just banner grabbing/ obtaining version information, once these details are known, the version is compared with any common vulnerabilities and exploits (CVE) that have been released and reported to the user. Other tools actually use manual pen testing methods and display the output received i.e. showmount -e ip_address would display the NFS shares available to the scanner whcih would then need to be verified by the tester.
