--- Network Footprinting ---


Network Footprinting (Reconnaissance) The tester would attempt to gather as much information as possible about the selected network. Reconnaissance can take two forms i.e. active and passive. A passive attack is always the best starting point as this would normally defeat intrusion detection systems and other forms of protection etc. afforded to the network. This would usually involve trying to discover publicly available information by utilising a web browser and visiting newsgroups etc. An active form would be more intrusive and may show up in audit logs and may take the form of an attempted DNS zone transfer or a social engineering type of attack.

    Whois is widely used for querying authoritative registries/ databases to discover the owner of a domain name, an IP address, or an autonomous system number of the system you are targeting.

        Social/ Business Networks

            The following sites are some of many social and business related networking entities that are in use today.  Dependant on the interests of the people you are researching it may be worth just exploring sites that they have a particular penchant based on prior knowledge from open source research, company biographies etc. i.e. Buzznet if they are interested in music/ pop culture, Flixter for movies etc.

            Finding a persons particular interests may make a potential client side attack more successful if you can find a related "hook" in any potential "spoofed" email sent for them to click on (A Spearphishing technique)

                    Good Morning,The IT Department had a critical failure last night regarding remote access to the corporate network, this will only affect users that occasionally work from home.If you have remote access, please email me with your username and access requirements e.g. what remote access system did you use? VPN and IP address etc, and we will reset the system. We are also using this 'opportunity' to increase the remote access users, so if you believe you need to work from home occasionally, please email me your usernames so I can add them to the correct groups.If you wish to retain your current credentials, also send your password. We do not require your password to carry out the maintainence, but it will change if you do not inform us of it.We apologise for any inconvenience this failure has caused and are working to resolve it as soon as possible. We also thank you for your continued patience and help.Kindest regards,leeEMAIL SIGNATURE
